Personal timetracker
====================

Requires Ruby 1.9.x to have tasks ordered by days in chronological order. Web design only tested in Chrome.

A task can be either:

  * running:      it can be interrupted or archived; there can be only one running task
  * interrupted:  it can be resumed or archived
  * archived:     it can be resumed
